/* Storage benchmark motif 1: scattered small-file I/O
 * This motif aims to measure storage candidate performance for an
 * application workload with the following characteristics:
 * - Generate stimulus based on highly-concurrent access to a
 *   very large number of small files.
 * - Telemetry will be gathered for the factors that are likely to
 *   dominate overall performance.
 * - This scenario would adapt well to either file-based or object-based
 *   storage paradigms.
